My Learning Journey‚è∞
[]Python: Python was my first step into the tech world, and this repository contains the exercises and practice projects I completed during my beginner course.

Why This Repository?
1. Proactive Learning: I believe in learning by doing, which is why I‚Äôm sharing my practice work here. My path is openly documented here, demonstrating my commitment to personal development.
2. Commitment to Improvement: While I‚Äôm not an expert, I‚Äôm determined to continue learning and taking on more complex projects. This repository will evolve as I expand my skill set.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
‚è∞Future Plans: I plan to document more of my learning journey, including additional courses and projects, in this repository and on GitHub.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What‚Äôs Next?
1. I am utilizing my expertise in business administration and my developing technical abilities to work on projects that connect the two fields. 
2. Continuously update this repository with new projects, in Python, as I progress in my learning journey.
