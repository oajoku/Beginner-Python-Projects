Iâ€™m using this file to keep track of my progress while I work through the Udemy course "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp". 
This course aims to teach me new things and refresh my memory of Python. 
I will be designing new projects for this convenient course, which I will share here. In addition to working on these projects, I will document my learning process for transparency's sake. 
I'll include all the challenges I face and how I overcome them. Thank you!
