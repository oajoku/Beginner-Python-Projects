Tip Calculator
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Project Description:
The Tip Calculator is a simple Python project designed to help users easily calculate the tip and split the bill among multiple people.


Features:
User Input: The user provides the total bill amount and selects a tip percentage (e.g., 10%, 12%, or 15%).
Bill Splitting: After choosing the tip percentage, the user inputs the number of people sharing the bill.
Accurate Calculation: The program then calculates the total tip and the final amount each person should pay, including their share of the tip.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How It Works:
The user inputs the total bill amount.
The user selects the percentage of the tip they want to leave.
The program asks how many people will split the bill.
The final result shows the amount each person should pay, including their share of the tip.

Tools Used:
Python Built-in Functions:
round(): Used to round the final amounts to two decimal places for clarity.
F-strings: Used for formatting output messages in a clean and readable way.
Arithmetic Operators: Used to calculate the tip and split the total bill among the users.

What I Learned:
This project helped me enhance my understanding of:

Using input functions to interact with users.
Working with arithmetic operations to perform percentage calculations.
Implementing control flow to process and display user-provided data.
Formatting outputs using f-strings for clear and user-friendly results.
