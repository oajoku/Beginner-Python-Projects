Python Input Exercise Attempt!üêç
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overview
This exercise was an attempt to practice capturing user inputs, performing simple string transformations, and producing results using Python's input() method. The idea was to develop a straightforward application that would ask the user for their name, age, and salary before understandably returning the data. As anticipated, I ran into a few problems that prevented the application from working.
