Python Input Exercise Attempt!üêç
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overview
This exercise was an attempt to practice capturing user inputs, performing simple string transformations, and producing results using Python's input() method. The idea was to develop a straightforward application that would ask the user for their name, age, and salary before understandably returning the data. As anticipated, I ran into a few problems that prevented the application from working.

Issues Encounteredüü•
1. Syntax Errors: Missing or incorrectly positioned parentheses and quote marks resulted in several¬†syntax mistakes.
2. Incorrect Data Type Handling: When attempting to merge a string using a built-in function or method, an error was encountered. Print('There are' + input, len(), for instance) resulted in a TypeError.
3. Unintentional Outputs: During execution, the program did not behave as anticipated, yielding wrong values or displaying syntactic mistakes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lessons Learnedüü©
1. Proper Syntax: When working with string inputs and functions, it's important to closely monitor the syntax, particularly when it comes to quote marks and parentheses.
2. Data Type Management: To prevent problems such as TypeError, it's critical to comprehend the distinctions between strings, integers, and other data types.
3. Debugging: SyntaxError and TypeError error messages offer helpful tips for fixing the code.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Next Steps‚ùó
1. Rewrite the code and try again: I'm going to make some changes to the data type handling and syntax and then try the exercise again.
2. Further Learning: To strengthen my comprehension and steer clear of similar errors in the future, I will go over the fundamental grammar and functions of Python.
